    <string name="detail_faketouch" >The device does not have a touch screen, but does support touch emulation for basic events. For instance, the device might use a mouse or remote control to drive a cursor, and emulate basic touch pointer events like down, up, drag, etc. All devices that support android.hardware.touchscreen or a sub-feature are presumed to also support faketouch.</string>
    <string name="detail_faketouch_multitouch_distinct" >The device does not have a touch screen, but does support touch emulation for basic events that supports distinct tracking of two or more fingers. This is an extension of FEATURE_FAKETOUCH for input devices with this capability. Note that unlike a distinct multitouch screen as defined by FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_DISTINCT, these kinds of input devices will not actually provide full two-finger gestures since the input is being transformed to cursor movement on the screen. That is, single finger gestures will move a cursor; two-finger swipes will result in single-finger touch events; other two-finger gestures will result in the corresponding two-finger touch event.</string>
    <string name="detail_faketouch_multitouch_jazzhand" >The device does not have a touch screen, but does support touch emulation for basic events that supports tracking a hand of fingers (5 or more fingers) fully independently.
